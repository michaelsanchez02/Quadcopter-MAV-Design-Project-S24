# Quadcopter-MAV-Design-Project-S24
Quadcopter MAV drone deisgn including manufacturing, electronics, controls, and simulation work.

This design project was my senior capstone project at the University of California, Los Angeles, while finishing my
aerospace engineering bachelor of science degree.

My primary responsibilities were to be the manufacturing and design lead. This role tasked me with performing CAD work
in SolidWorks to design the drone assembly and manufacture key components of the drone. The original CAD work included
the frame design and component mounts, with other key components provided by manufacturers or grabCAD (i.e. Livox Mid-360
LiDAR, Teensy 4.0 autopilot, Jetson Nano flight computer, etc.). The key components that required manufacturing were the
frame (waterjet) and component mounts (3D-print). Using the SolidWorks McMaster-Carr add-in allowed for the organization
of a bill-of-materials (BOM). This included standoffs, screws, nuts, and velcro straps.

In addition to primary responsibilities, I contributed to the other subsystems of the drone design. For the electronics
subsystem, I fully developed the wiring diagram and assisted in soldering connections (motors to the electronic speed
controller (ESC) and headers to the autopilot (that connect to the flight computer)). For the controls subsystem, I
contributed some MATLAB code seen in the attached lab report. 

Throughout the senior capstone course, I wrote out technical reports detailing any experiments conducted to perform a
design choice. The attached reports refer to experiments such as materials testing (for frame material design choice),
motor and propeller testing (for propeller design choice), and IMU calibration. Every attached technical report was
written and developed by only myself. Refer to the acknowledgements section for any references to assistance in data
collection or MATLAB code inspiration.

This project taught me important skills like electronic wiring, soldering, and ordering hardware. It also reinforced previously 
known skills like CAD (SolidWorks), programming (MATLAB), manufacturing (3D-printing), and electronics wiring. This was my
first exposure to quadcopter MAV design, which has inspired me to create drones in the future from home as a personal project
(once I can afford it). I enjoyed working as a group with my peers and learned so much from them in the process.
